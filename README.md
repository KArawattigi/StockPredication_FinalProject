Stock Prediction using RNN and LSTM 

# LSTM Model Predication
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models are a type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) specifically designed to address the issue of long-term dependencies in sequential data

# Why LSTM for Stock Prediction:
- Capturing Temporal Dependencies: Stock prices are influenced by past trends, and LSTMs can effectively capture and utilize these dependencies.
- Handling Non-Linear Relationships: LSTMs can model complex, non-linear relationships in stock data, which is often necessary for accurate predictions.
- Mitigating Long-Term Dependency Issues: LSTM’s architecture allows it to remember important trends over long periods, which is crucial for stock price forecasting.
